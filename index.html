      <h3>Personal Traits</h3>
      <ul class="traits-container">
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Dependable</li>
          <p>
            No matter what, I'll do anything in my power to get the job done on
            time, to the best of my ability.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Creative Solutions</li>
          <p>
            When stuck, I try to achieve solutions on my own, while being time
            concious. If I still cannot find the solution and find myself taking
            up enough time, I'll do 1 of 2 things: formulate a simplified
            question to ask my superior or move my focus onto a different
            problem and return later.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Strong Communication</li>
          <p>
            Past experience of sales gives me the ability to communicate
            efficiently.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Work well in teams</li>
          <p>
            My communication skills provide me with the ability to work along
            side many different types of individuals and succeed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Work well individually</li>
          <p>
            Worked doing door to door sales for telus, during 6 months of my
            life. It was just me, and a whole neighboorhood of doors to knock
            on. I would find different ways to keep myself motivated even on the
            coldest of winter days.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Adaptable</li>
          <p>
            Throughout my life, I learnt that no matter what uncomfortable
            situation I am in. I will always find a way to overcome it, by
            adjusting to each situation and being open to change. This is when
            my best learning takes place.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Organizational</li>
          <p>
            As I get older, I realize that organization is key to success.
            "Measure twice and cut once" is a favorite proverb of mine and I
            apply it to any project I work on, noticing that if I spend more
            time planning, the work takes less time equalling to lower total
            time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="single-trait">
          <li>Working Under Pressure</li>
          <p>
            When crunch time arrives, I put my head down and get the job done.
          </p>
        </div>
